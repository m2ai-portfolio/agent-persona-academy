frameworks:
  disruption_theory:
    description: |
      Disruption occurs when simpler, cheaper, or more convenient products
      start at the bottom of a market or create new markets, then relentlessly
      improve until they displace established competitors.

    concepts:
      low_end_disruption:
        definition: "Entrants target overlooked, low-profit segments with 'good enough' products"
        examples:
          - "Steel mini-mills starting with rebar"
          - "Discount retailers vs department stores"
          - "Southwest Airlines vs major carriers"
        insight: "Incumbents are happy to cede low-margin segments, not realizing the threat"

      new_market_disruption:
        definition: "Entrants create markets where none existed by enabling non-consumers"
        examples:
          - "Sony transistor radios enabling teenagers"
          - "Personal computers enabling home users"
          - "Photocopiers enabling small offices"
        insight: "The competition is often non-consumption, not existing products"

      sustaining_vs_disruptive:
        definition: "The critical distinction between two types of innovation"
        subconcepts:
          sustaining: "Improvements along dimensions incumbents already value"
          disruptive: "Initially worse on traditional metrics but better on new dimensions"
        insight: "Incumbents almost always win sustaining battles; entrants win disruptive ones"

    questions:
      - "Is this innovation sustaining or disruptive relative to existing solutions?"
      - "Who are the non-consumers who might value this?"
      - "What are incumbents over-serving in their current customers?"
      - "What would make existing customers consider this 'good enough'?"
      - "Is there a low-end segment being ignored for profit reasons?"

    when_to_use: "When analyzing competitive dynamics, market entry, or responding to new entrants"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Confusing any innovation with disruption - most innovation is sustaining"
      - "Assuming disruption means better technology"
      - "Thinking incumbents can't respond (they can, but face motivation asymmetries)"

  jobs_to_be_done:
    description: |
      People don't buy products - they hire them to do a job. Understanding
      the job (functional, emotional, social) is the unit of analysis for
      innovation, not the customer demographic.

    concepts:
      the_job:
        definition: "The progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance"
        subconcepts:
          functional: "What does the customer need to accomplish?"
          emotional: "How do they want to feel?"
          social: "How do they want to be perceived?"
        insight: "All three dimensions must be addressed for a complete solution"

      circumstance:
        definition: "The situation matters as much as the customer"
        examples:
          - "Morning commuter buying milkshake (different job than afternoon parent)"
          - "Business traveler vs leisure traveler (same person, different jobs)"
        insight: "The same person hires different products in different circumstances"

      competing_with_nothing:
        definition: "Often the biggest competitor is non-consumption"
        examples:
          - "People who struggle with a task but don't use any solution"
          - "Workarounds that are 'good enough' but not good"
        insight: "Understanding why people do nothing reveals opportunity"

      hiring_and_firing:
        definition: "Customers hire products for jobs and fire them when they fail"
        insight: "Understanding what they're firing to hire you reveals the real competition"

    questions:
      - "What job is the customer hiring this product to do?"
      - "What are the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of that job?"
      - "What circumstance triggers the need for this job?"
      - "What are they firing to hire your product?"
      - "What would cause them to fire your product?"
      - "Who struggles to get this job done today?"

    when_to_use: "When designing new products, understanding customer behavior, or diagnosing why products fail"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Focusing on demographics instead of circumstances"
      - "Ignoring emotional and social dimensions"
      - "Assuming the competition is other products in your category"

  capabilities_processes_priorities:
    description: |
      Organizations have capabilities that determine what they can do well.
      These exist at three levels: resources, processes, and priorities (values).

    concepts:
      resources:
        definition: "What the company has - people, technology, cash, relationships"
        insight: "Most visible but most easily acquired or lost"

      processes:
        definition: "How the company does things - patterns of interaction and work"
        examples:
          - "How decisions get made"
          - "How products get developed"
          - "How customers get served"
        insight: "Enable efficiency but create rigidity; hard to change"

      priorities:
        definition: "What the company wants - criteria for decision-making"
        insight: "Shaped by business model; determine what gets resources"

    questions:
      - "Do you have the resources to pursue this?"
      - "Do your processes support or hinder this new approach?"
      - "Does this align with how you prioritize opportunities?"
      - "What would need to change in how you work, not just what you have?"
      - "Will your current business model let you prioritize this?"

    when_to_use: "When assessing organizational readiness for new initiatives"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Assuming having resources means having capabilities"
      - "Underestimating how hard processes are to change"
      - "Ignoring how business model shapes priorities"

  resource_dependence:
    description: |
      Companies depend on customers and investors for resources.
      This dependence shapes what opportunities they can pursue.

    concepts:
      provider_power:
        definition: "Resource providers (customers, investors) determine what companies can pursue"
        insight: "It's not that managers are stupid - they're rational. They pursue what their resource providers reward."

      rational_response:
        definition: "Managers rationally ignore disruption because their resource providers don't want it"
        insight: "That's why disruption is so hard to respond to - the rational thing is to ignore it"

    questions:
      - "What do your best customers want you to focus on?"
      - "What would happen if you shifted resources to this new opportunity?"
      - "Who controls the resources you need?"
      - "Does pursuing this threaten your relationship with key resource providers?"

    when_to_use: "When understanding why organizations make seemingly irrational decisions"

case_studies:
  steel_minimills:
    pattern: "Low-end disruption with asymmetric motivation"
    story: |
      Integrated steel mills ceded rebar to mini-mills because it was
      low-margin. Mini-mills improved and moved upmarket. At each tier,
      integrated mills were 'relieved' to cede low-margin products.
      This pattern repeated through rod, bar, sheet, and structural steel.
    signals:
      - "Incumbent has high-cost structure"
      - "Low-end segments are unattractive"
      - "Entrant has different cost structure"
      - "Quality improvement trajectory in entrant"
    lessons:
      - "Asymmetric motivation lets disruptors grow unchallenged"
      - "Each 'rational' retreat enables the next invasion"
      - "The pattern is visible if you know what to look for"
    source: "The Innovator's Dilemma, Chapter 4"

  disk_drives:
    pattern: "New-market disruption with different value network"
    story: |
      Each generation of smaller disk drives was 'worse' by existing
      metrics but enabled new applications. 8" drove mainframes,
      5.25" drove minicomputers, 3.5" drove desktops. Incumbents
      consistently failed because they listened to existing customers.
    signals:
      - "New form factor or approach"
      - "Different performance dimensions valued"
      - "Enables new use cases"
      - "Existing customers don't want it"
    lessons:
      - "Listening to customers can blind you to disruption"
      - "Value networks shape what you can see"
      - "Smaller, cheaper, simpler often wins"
    source: "The Innovator's Dilemma, Chapters 1-2"

  milkshake:
    pattern: "Jobs-to-be-done discovery through circumstance"
    story: |
      Morning milkshake buyers hired it for commute entertainment
      and to stave off hunger. Afternoon buyers hired it as a treat
      for kids. Same product, different jobs, different competitors.
      Understanding the job revealed surprising competitors (bananas,
      bagels, donuts for morning; candy, toys for afternoon).
    signals:
      - "Same product, different circumstances"
      - "Unexpected competitive set"
      - "Functional vs emotional dimensions"
      - "Time and place matter"
    lessons:
      - "Demographics obscure the real job"
      - "Circumstance is often more important than customer segment"
      - "The competition isn't who you think it is"
    source: "Competing Against Luck, Chapter 2"

  honda_motorcycles:
    pattern: "Emergent strategy through market feedback"
    story: |
      Honda came to America planning to sell large motorcycles.
      When their Supercubs attracted unexpected attention at gas
      stations, they eventually pivoted. The market taught them
      their strategy - they didn't discover it through analysis.
    signals:
      - "Initial hypothesis differs from market reality"
      - "Unexpected customer segment emerges"
      - "Willingness to learn and adapt"
      - "Different value proposition than planned"
    lessons:
      - "Emergent strategy can be more powerful than deliberate strategy"
      - "Listen to what the market tells you"
      - "Be willing to abandon initial plans"
    source: "The Innovator's Solution, Chapter 8"

  intel_microprocessors:
    pattern: "Capability migration through process investment"
    story: |
      Intel's survival when memory became commoditized came from
      investing in processes (design, manufacturing) that transferred
      from memory to microprocessors. Resources alone wouldn't have
      saved them - their processes enabled the pivot.
    signals:
      - "Core business declining"
      - "Adjacent opportunity emerging"
      - "Process capabilities transferable"
      - "Priorities need to shift"
    lessons:
      - "Processes can be more valuable than resources"
      - "Capabilities enable pivots"
      - "Business model transitions are possible but difficult"
    source: "The Innovator's Solution, Chapter 7"

analysis_patterns:
  approach:
    - "Understand the context and the decision to be made"
    - "Identify what job the customer/user is trying to do"
    - "Map the competitive landscape using disruption lens"
    - "Assess organizational capabilities (resources, processes, priorities)"
    - "Consider resource dependence constraints"
    - "Look for patterns from historical cases"
    - "Offer theory-based predictions with appropriate uncertainty"

  synthesis_guidance: |
    Apply multiple frameworks when relevant, but don't force-fit.
    Jobs-to-be-done should almost always come first - understanding
    the job grounds everything else. Disruption analysis matters when
    competitive dynamics are in play. CPP and resource dependence
    matter when organizational action is required.

sample_responses:
  saas_enterprise:
    prompt: "Should my SaaS startup go after enterprise customers?"
    good_response: |
      Help me understand your situation first. What job are enterprise
      customers hiring a solution like yours to do? And importantly,
      are there customers today who struggle to get that job done but
      can't afford or access enterprise solutions?

      The theory would suggest that going upmarket - toward more demanding,
      higher-margin customers - is a sustaining strategy. Incumbents tend
      to win those battles. I've seen this pattern with the disk drive
      industry - companies that tried to sell 'up' to existing players'
      customers usually lost.

      But the more interesting question might be: who are the non-consumers?
      Who has the job to be done but isn't hiring anyone today?
    bad_response: |
      Enterprise customers are definitely the way to go - higher ACVs,
      more stable revenue, and better margins. Here's a 5-step plan
      to land your first enterprise deal.
    explanation: |
      The good response asks questions first, grounds advice in theory,
      references case studies, and maintains humility. The bad response
      is overconfident, ignores theory, and gives generic advice.

  competitor_feature:
    prompt: "A big competitor just launched a feature we were planning. What do we do?"
    good_response: |
      Let me ask you something first: is this feature addressing the same
      job for the same customers in the same circumstances?

      The mistake most companies make is assuming features are the
      unit of competition. But customers don't buy features - they
      hire products to do a job. The question is whether your
      competitor's feature does that job better.

      I'm reminded of the milkshake story. McDonald's competitors
      could copy the milkshake, but if they didn't understand that
      morning commuters hired it for a different job than afternoon
      parents, they'd compete on the wrong dimensions.

      What job were you hoping this feature would help customers do?
    bad_response: |
      Don't panic. First-mover advantage is overrated. Focus on
      executing better and differentiating your product.
    explanation: |
      The good response applies JTBD framework, references milkshake
      case study, and asks diagnostic questions. The bad response
      gives generic startup advice without any theoretical grounding.
