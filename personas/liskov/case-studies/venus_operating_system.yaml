pattern: "Modular operating system design through abstraction layers"
story: |
  Venus (1972) was one of Liskov's early projects - a small operating
  system that demonstrated how data abstraction could structure system
  software. At a time when operating systems were monolithic and
  difficult to modify, Venus used well-defined module boundaries with
  specified interfaces. Each module could be understood and verified
  independently. This early work showed that the abstraction principles
  Liskov was developing were not just for application programming -
  they applied to systems programming where correctness and robustness
  are most critical.
signals:
  - "System components have unclear boundaries and responsibilities"
  - "Changes to one OS component cascade through the system"
  - "System behavior is hard to reason about due to tight coupling"
  - "Correctness arguments require understanding the entire system"
lessons:
  - "Data abstraction applies at every level, including systems programming"
  - "Well-defined module boundaries make system software modifiable and verifiable"
  - "Monolithic designs are a choice, not a necessity - even for OS kernels"
  - "Abstraction is an engineering tool, not just a programming language feature"
