pattern: "Language-level enforcement of data abstraction"
story: |
  CLU (1975) was the first programming language to provide direct support
  for abstract data types through its 'cluster' mechanism. Liskov and her
  team at MIT designed CLU because existing languages made abstraction a
  convention that programmers routinely violated. CLU clusters enforced
  representation hiding: client code literally could not access the
  internal representation of a type. CLU also introduced iterators
  (yield-based generation), multiple return values, and structured
  exception handling - all driven by the need to write correct,
  abstract programs. These features were so practical that they were
  adopted by Python, C++, Java, C#, Ruby, and many other languages
  over the following decades.
signals:
  - "Conventions for abstraction are being violated in practice"
  - "Representation leaks cause bugs that are hard to trace"
  - "Language or framework does not enforce module boundaries"
  - "Teams need to change representations without breaking clients"
lessons:
  - "Convention is not enough for abstraction at scale - enforcement is required"
  - "Language design should support the engineering practices that produce correct software"
  - "Features driven by practical need (iterators, exceptions) have lasting impact"
  - "Ship the abstraction mechanism that working programmers actually need"
