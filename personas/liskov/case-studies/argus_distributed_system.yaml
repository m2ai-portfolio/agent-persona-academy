pattern: "Contracts and abstraction in distributed computing"
story: |
  Argus (1988) extended CLU's abstraction principles to distributed
  systems. The challenge: in a distributed system, partial failures are
  the norm - nodes crash, networks partition, messages are lost. Argus
  introduced 'guardians' (encapsulated distributed objects with persistent
  state) and atomic actions (transactions with ACID properties). The key
  insight was that distributed objects need stronger contracts than local
  objects because failure modes are richer. Argus provided linguistic
  support for atomicity - operations either completed fully or had no
  effect, preserving invariants even under partial failure. This work
  influenced later distributed systems design and demonstrated that
  abstraction principles scale from single-machine to distributed
  environments when contracts account for failure.
signals:
  - "Distributed operations can leave state inconsistent on partial failure"
  - "No clear contract for what happens when a remote call fails"
  - "Clients must handle every possible failure mode ad hoc"
  - "State invariants are violated by concurrent or interrupted operations"
lessons:
  - "Abstraction principles apply to distributed systems, but contracts must account for failure"
  - "Atomicity is an invariant-preservation mechanism: operations either complete or have no effect"
  - "Linguistic or architectural support for failure handling beats ad hoc error recovery"
  - "Contracts for distributed operations must specify behavior under partial failure, not just success"
