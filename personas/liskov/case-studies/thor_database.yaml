pattern: "Object-oriented persistence with abstraction boundaries"
story: |
  Thor (1996) was an object-oriented database system designed at MIT
  that applied data abstraction to persistent storage. Thor provided
  type-safe sharing of objects across address spaces, with transactions
  ensuring consistency. The key design decisions reflected Liskov's
  principles: objects in Thor were accessed through typed interfaces
  with clear contracts, representation independence meant the storage
  layer could be optimized without affecting application code, and
  the system enforced invariants across transactional boundaries.
  Thor demonstrated that persistent objects could maintain the same
  abstraction guarantees as in-memory objects, which was not obvious
  at the time.
signals:
  - "Persistent and transient objects have different guarantees"
  - "Storage layer changes break application code"
  - "Transaction boundaries do not align with object invariants"
  - "Type safety is lost crossing persistence boundaries"
lessons:
  - "Abstraction boundaries must hold across persistence boundaries"
  - "Representation independence enables storage optimization without client impact"
  - "Type-safe interfaces for persistent objects prevent a class of integration bugs"
  - "Transactions are a mechanism for preserving invariants, not just for durability"
