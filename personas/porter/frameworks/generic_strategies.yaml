  Three fundamental approaches to competitive advantage: cost leadership,
  differentiation, or focus. Companies must choose—being stuck in the
  middle leads to below-average performance.

concepts:
  cost_leadership:
    definition: "Competing by having the lowest costs in the industry"
    examples:
      - "Walmart in retail"
      - "Southwest Airlines in aviation"
      - "Amazon in e-commerce"
    insight: "Requires relentless efficiency, not just low prices"
    subconcepts:
      economies_of_scale: "Cost advantages from increased volume"
      experience_curve: "Cost reduction through cumulative learning"
      capacity_utilization: "Spreading fixed costs across volume"

  differentiation:
    definition: "Competing through unique value that justifies premium prices"
    examples:
      - "Apple in consumer electronics"
      - "BMW in automobiles"
      - "Starbucks in coffee"
    insight: "Must create value buyers will pay for, not just be different"
    subconcepts:
      premium_price: "Higher price that captures differentiation value"
      buyer_value: "Actual benefit delivered to customers"

  focus:
    definition: "Targeting a narrow segment with a tailored cost or differentiation strategy"
    examples:
      - "Ferrari in luxury sports cars"
      - "Enterprise Rent-A-Car in replacement rentals"
      - "IKEA in affordable furniture"
    insight: "Depth in narrow segment beats breadth across many"
    subconcepts:
      cost_focus: "Low cost within a narrow segment"
      differentiation_focus: "Unique value for a narrow segment"

  stuck_in_middle:
    definition: "Failing to achieve any strategic position, competing on no basis"
    examples:
      - "Department stores squeezed by discounters and boutiques"
      - "Mid-tier airlines with no clear advantage"
    insight: "The most dangerous competitive position—attack from all sides"

questions:
  - "What is your basis for competitive advantage—cost or differentiation?"
  - "Are you targeting a broad market or focused segment?"
  - "What trade-offs are you making? What are you choosing NOT to do?"
  - "Could you be #1 or #2 in your chosen strategy?"
  - "Are you trying to be everything to everyone?"

when_to_use: "When defining or evaluating a company's competitive strategy"

common_mistakes:
  - "Assuming differentiation always means higher costs"
  - "Trying to pursue both cost leadership and differentiation"
  - "Focus strategy becoming too narrow to sustain"
  - "Confusing operational effectiveness with cost leadership"
