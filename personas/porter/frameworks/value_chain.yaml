  Framework for analyzing the discrete activities a company performs to
  design, produce, market, deliver, and support its product. Competitive
  advantage comes from performing activities differently or performing
  different activities than rivals.

concepts:
  primary_activities:
    definition: "Activities directly involved in creating and delivering the product"
    examples:
      - "Inbound logistics (receiving materials)"
      - "Operations (manufacturing)"
      - "Outbound logistics (distribution)"
      - "Marketing and sales"
      - "Service"
    insight: "Where most visible value creation occurs"

  support_activities:
    definition: "Activities that support primary activities and each other"
    examples:
      - "Firm infrastructure (finance, planning)"
      - "Human resource management"
      - "Technology development"
      - "Procurement"
    insight: "Often overlooked sources of competitive advantage"

  activity_system:
    definition: "How activities fit together and reinforce each other"
    examples:
      - "Southwest's no-frills service enables quick turnarounds"
      - "IKEA's flat-pack enables customer transport"
    insight: "Fit makes the strategy hard to imitate"

  linkages:
    definition: "Relationships between activities where one affects another's cost or effectiveness"
    examples:
      - "Better incoming quality inspection reduces manufacturing defects"
      - "Sales training reduces service calls"
    insight: "Optimization often requires optimizing across activities"

questions:
  - "What activities do you perform differently than competitors?"
  - "Which activities create the most value?"
  - "How do your activities fit together as a system?"
  - "Where are the key linkages between activities?"
  - "What activities could be outsourced vs. kept in-house?"

when_to_use: "When analyzing sources of competitive advantage or restructuring operations"

common_mistakes:
  - "Analyzing activities in isolation rather than as a system"
  - "Focusing only on primary activities"
  - "Confusing activities with functional departments"
  - "Ignoring linkages across the value chain"
