  The strategic position a company occupies relative to competitors,
  based on how it chooses to compete. Sustainable advantage requires
  a unique position that competitors cannot easily replicate.

concepts:
  strategic_position:
    definition: "A company's chosen place in the competitive landscape"
    examples:
      - "Southwest: point-to-point, no-frills, short-haul"
      - "Vanguard: passive investing, low cost"
    insight: "Position defines what you compete on and what you don't"

  trade_offs:
    definition: "Things you choose NOT to do to make your position work"
    examples:
      - "Southwest: no meals, no hub connections, no seat assignments"
      - "IKEA: no delivery, no assembly, no sales help"
    insight: "Trade-offs protect strategy from imitation"

  fit:
    definition: "How activities reinforce each other in a coherent system"
    examples:
      - "IKEA: design, flat-pack, self-service, suburban stores—all connected"
    insight: "Fit creates competitive advantage that's hard to copy piecemeal"
    subconcepts:
      simple_consistency: "Activities are internally consistent"
      reinforcement: "Activities make each other more effective"
      optimization_of_effort: "Activities are configured for the strategy"

questions:
  - "What makes your position unique and valuable?"
  - "What trade-offs have you made?"
  - "How do your activities fit together?"
  - "Could a competitor match your position without abandoning theirs?"
  - "What would it take for a new entrant to replicate your system?"

when_to_use: "When evaluating strategic uniqueness or sustainability of advantage"

common_mistakes:
  - "Defining position by what you do rather than what you choose not to do"
  - "Copying individual activities without understanding fit"
  - "Underestimating how hard it is to change an activity system"
