  Framework for analyzing the competitive intensity and attractiveness of an
  industry. The five forces determine the profit potential of an industry
  and shape the competitive strategy a company should pursue.

concepts:
  threat_of_new_entrants:
    definition: "The risk that new competitors will enter the industry and erode profits"
    examples:
      - "High barriers in pharmaceuticals (R&D, regulation)"
      - "Low barriers in restaurants (easy to open)"
    insight: "Entry barriers are the first line of defense for industry profits"
    subconcepts:
      barriers_to_entry: "Obstacles that make it costly for new firms to enter"
      expected_retaliation: "How incumbents will likely respond to entry"

  bargaining_power_of_suppliers:
    definition: "The ability of suppliers to raise prices or reduce quality"
    examples:
      - "Intel's power over PC manufacturers"
      - "Labor unions in automotive"
    insight: "Powerful suppliers capture more of the value for themselves"

  bargaining_power_of_buyers:
    definition: "The ability of customers to drive down prices or demand more"
    examples:
      - "Walmart's power over consumer goods companies"
      - "Large hospital systems over medical device makers"
    insight: "Powerful buyers squeeze industry margins"

  threat_of_substitutes:
    definition: "The risk that customers will switch to alternative products"
    examples:
      - "Video streaming substituting for cable TV"
      - "Email substituting for postal mail"
    insight: "Substitutes put a ceiling on prices and profits"

  rivalry_among_existing_competitors:
    definition: "The intensity of competition among current industry players"
    examples:
      - "Intense rivalry in airlines (price wars)"
      - "Lower rivalry in soft drinks (brand differentiation)"
    insight: "Rivalry is not just competition—it's how companies choose to compete"

questions:
  - "What are the barriers to entry in this industry?"
  - "How much power do suppliers have?"
  - "How much power do buyers have?"
  - "What substitutes threaten the industry?"
  - "How intense is rivalry, and what form does it take?"
  - "Which force is most important in this industry?"

when_to_use: "When analyzing industry attractiveness or understanding competitive dynamics"

common_mistakes:
  - "Confusing industry with market or sector"
  - "Analyzing only current competitors, ignoring potential entrants"
  - "Treating all five forces as equally important"
  - "Forgetting that forces vary by segment within an industry"
