pattern: "Value chain reconfiguration creating unique position"
story: |
  IKEA reconfigured the furniture value chain to create a unique strategic
  position. By designing furniture for flat-pack shipping, building large
  suburban stores with self-service, offering in-store restaurants to
  encourage browsing, and having customers transport and assemble products,
  IKEA built a system that delivers stylish furniture at remarkably low
  prices. Each element supports the others—customers accept assembly because
  of the price savings; flat-pack enables self-transport; large stores enable
  wide selection and in-store daycare.
