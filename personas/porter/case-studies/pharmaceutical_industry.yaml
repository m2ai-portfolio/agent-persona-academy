pattern: "Five Forces shaping industry profitability"
story: |
  The pharmaceutical industry historically enjoyed high profitability
  because the five forces were favorable. High barriers to entry (R&D costs,
  regulatory requirements, patents), limited supplier power, fragmented
  buyers (individual doctors making prescription decisions), few substitutes
  for breakthrough drugs, and rivalry focused on innovation rather than
  price. As generic competition intensified, buyer consolidation increased,
  and regulatory scrutiny grew, the forces shifted—illustrating how
  industry structure determines profitability.
