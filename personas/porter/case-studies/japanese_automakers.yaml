pattern: "Operational effectiveness is not strategy"
story: |
  In the 1980s, Japanese automakers achieved remarkable operational
  effectiveness through lean manufacturing, total quality management, and
  continuous improvement. American companies spent years trying to copy
  these practices. But operational effectiveness alone didn't create
  sustainable competitive advantage—as American firms caught up, the
  Japanese advantage diminished. The lesson: operational effectiveness is
  necessary but not sufficient. Strategy requires a unique position that
  competitors cannot easily replicate.
signals:
  - "Operational effectiveness vs. strategy distinction"
  - "Competitive imitation"
  - "Temporary vs. sustainable advantage"
  - "Manufacturing excellence"
lessons:
  - "Best practices spread and erode advantage"
  - "Operational effectiveness is necessary but not sufficient"
  - "Strategy must create a position that's hard to imitate"
  - "Competition on the same dimensions leads to convergence"
