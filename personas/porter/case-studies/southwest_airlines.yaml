pattern: "Strategic positioning through conscious trade-offs and activity fit"
story: |
  Southwest Airlines created a fundamentally different strategic position in
  the airline industry. By choosing short-haul, point-to-point routes with
  no meals, no seat assignments, no baggage transfers, and a single aircraft
  type, Southwest built an activity system where every element reinforces the
  others. Quick turnarounds enable more flights per day. No hub connections
  eliminate complexity. A single aircraft type simplifies maintenance and
  training. Competitors couldn't copy Southwest by adopting individual
  practices—they'd have to abandon their own systems entirely.
