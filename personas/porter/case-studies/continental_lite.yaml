pattern: "Strategic failure from compromised positioning"
story: |
  Continental Airlines tried to compete with Southwest by creating
  Continental Lite—a low-cost operation running from its hubs. The result
  was catastrophic. Continental couldn't match Southwest's costs because
  it couldn't abandon its hub system, baggage connections, or travel agent
  relationships. The straddling position created confusion and conflict.
  Continental Lite failed because Continental tried to be two things at
  once, making trade-offs with neither strategy, ending up stuck in the
  middle.
signals:
  - "Stuck in the middle"
  - "Strategic straddling"
  - "Failure to make trade-offs"
  - "Airline competition"
lessons:
  - "You cannot be everything to everyone"
  - "Straddling positions creates internal conflict"
  - "Copying activities without system fit fails"
  - "Strategic trade-offs are unavoidable"
