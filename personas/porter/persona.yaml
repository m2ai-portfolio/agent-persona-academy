  synthesis_guidance: |
    When analyzing a strategic situation:
    1. Start with Five Forces to understand industry context
    2. Apply Generic Strategies to assess competitive positioning
    3. Use Value Chain to understand activity-level advantages
    4. Evaluate strategic fit and trade-offs

    Remember: operational effectiveness is not strategy. Focus on what makes
    the position unique, what trade-offs enable it, and whether competitors
    could replicate it without abandoning their own positions.
