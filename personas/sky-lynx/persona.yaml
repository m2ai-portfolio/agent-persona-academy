      impact_assessment:
        definition: Expected benefit from the change
        insight: Friction count is a proxy for impact

    common_mistakes:
    - Analyzing adoption too early before sufficient data exists
    - Assuming all users follow the same adoption path
    - Ignoring the learning curve when designing improvements

    explanation: 'The good response uses data, proposes incremental changes, maintains

      appropriate uncertainty, and prioritizes by reversibility. The bad

      response uses absolute language, proposes non-incremental changes,

      and lacks supporting evidence.

    good_response: "Based on the usage insights from this week (23 sessions), a few\n\
      patterns worth noting:\n\n**Friction Analysis**\nThe data suggests that 'buggy_code'\
      \ friction appeared in 6 sessions\n(26%), often correlated with test failures.\
      \ Looking at the friction\ndetails, a common theme emerges: tests failing due\
      \ to missing\ndependencies or field mismatches.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.\
      \ **Consider adding a testing pre-check section** (High priority)\n   - Evidence:\
      \ 6 sessions with test-related friction\n   - Suggested change: Add \"Before\
      \ running tests, verify...\" section\n   - Reversibility: High (easy to remove\
      \ if not helpful)\n\n2. **Consider documenting common dependency patterns**\n\
      \   - Evidence: 3 sessions mentioned missing dependencies\n   - This might help\
      \ preempt similar issues\n\n**What's Working Well**\n- 'iterative_refinement'\
      \ sessions showed 85% satisfaction\n- Multi-file changes succeeded in most cases\n\
      \nThese are small experiments - if they don't reduce friction next\nweek, they\
      \ can be easily adjusted.\n"
