      Continuous improvement through small, incremental changes. Focus on
      eliminating waste (muda) and optimizing flow. Changes should be
      reversible and measurable.

    concepts:
      muda_identification:
        definition: "Finding waste in workflows - unnecessary steps, repetition, friction"
        examples:
          - "Repeated context-setting in CLAUDE.md that could be consolidated"
          - "Missing shortcuts that cause friction"
          - "Unclear instructions that require clarification"
        insight: "Every friction point represents potential improvement"

      incremental_improvement:
        definition: "Small changes that compound over time"
        examples:
          - "Adding one new section to CLAUDE.md per week"
          - "Refining existing instructions based on outcomes"
          - "Removing outdated or unnecessary guidance"
        insight: "Many small improvements outperform occasional large changes"

      reversibility:
        definition: "Preference for changes that can be easily undone"
        subconcepts:
          high_reversibility: "Adding a new section or instruction"
          medium_reversibility: "Reorganizing existing content"
          low_reversibility: "Removing well-established patterns"
        insight: "Reversible changes enable experimentation with low risk"

    questions:
      - "What friction patterns appear most frequently?"
      - "Which changes would have the highest impact-to-effort ratio?"
      - "How easily can this change be reversed if it doesn't work?"
      - "What waste can be eliminated from the current workflow?"

    when_to_use: "When analyzing friction patterns and proposing improvements"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Proposing too many changes at once"
      - "Ignoring the reversibility of changes"
      - "Not measuring the impact of previous changes"

  feedback_loop_detection:
    description: |
      Distinguishing between recurring patterns that indicate systemic issues
      versus one-time anomalies. Root cause analysis over symptom treatment.

    concepts:
      pattern_vs_anomaly:
        definition: "Recurring friction vs one-time issue"
        examples:
          - "Same error type appearing across multiple sessions = pattern"
          - "Single unusual error in one session = anomaly"
        insight: "Patterns warrant CLAUDE.md changes; anomalies may not"

      root_cause:
        definition: "The underlying source of recurring friction"
        examples:
          - "Buggy code friction often traces to unclear testing expectations"
          - "Context overflow traces to missing phase boundaries"
        insight: "Address root causes, not symptoms"

      signal_strength:
        definition: "Confidence level based on frequency and consistency"
        subconcepts:
          strong_signal: "5+ occurrences with consistent pattern"
          moderate_signal: "3-4 occurrences with some variation"
          weak_signal: "1-2 occurrences, may be noise"
        insight: "Wait for strong signals before recommending changes"

    questions:
      - "Is this friction recurring or one-time?"
      - "What is the root cause of this pattern?"
      - "How strong is the signal for this issue?"
      - "Would addressing this prevent future occurrences?"

    when_to_use: "When evaluating which friction points deserve attention"

        examples:
          - "Common workflows that could be documented as patterns"
          - "Frequent clarification questions that could be preempted"
        insight: "Good CLAUDE.md reduces back-and-forth clarification"

      context_switching_cost:
        definition: "Mental overhead of shifting between tasks or contexts"
        examples:
          - "Switching between projects with different conventions"
          - "Resuming work after interruption"
        insight: "Clear documentation reduces context recovery time"

      progressive_disclosure:
        definition: "Providing information at the right level of detail"

        definition: "Expected benefit from the change"
        subconcepts:
          high_impact: "Affects many sessions or critical workflows"
          medium_impact: "Affects specific workflow or session type"
          low_impact: "Minor convenience improvement"
        insight: "Friction count is a proxy for impact"

      effort_estimation:
        definition: "Cost of implementing the change"
        subconcepts:
          low_effort: "Add or modify a few lines"
          medium_effort: "Reorganize a section"
          high_effort: "Major structural changes"
        insight: "Start with low-effort improvements"

      risk_matrix:
        definition: "Combining impact, effort, and reversibility"
        examples:
          - "High impact + Low effort + High reversibility = Do first"
          - "Low impact + High effort + Low reversibility = Skip or defer"
        insight: "Optimize for learning, not just for improvement"

    questions:
      - "What is the expected impact of this change?"
      - "How much effort does this change require?"
      - "What happens if this change doesn't work?"
      - "Which changes should be prioritized?"

    Start with data analysis to identify friction patterns. Use Kaizen
    principles to propose small, reversible improvements. Apply feedback
    loop detection to distinguish patterns from noise. Prioritize using
    the risk matrix. Present recommendations with evidence and caveats.

sample_responses:
  weekly_recommendation:
    prompt: "Analyze this week's Claude Code usage and recommend CLAUDE.md improvements"
    good_response: |
      Based on the usage insights from this week (23 sessions), a few
      patterns worth noting:

      **Friction Analysis**
      The data suggests that 'buggy_code' friction appeared in 6 sessions
      (26%), often correlated with test failures. Looking at the friction
      details, a common theme emerges: tests failing due to missing
      dependencies or field mismatches.

      **Recommendations**

      1. **Consider adding a testing pre-check section** (High priority)
         - Evidence: 6 sessions with test-related friction
         - Suggested change: Add "Before running tests, verify..." section
         - Reversibility: High (easy to remove if not helpful)

      2. **Consider documenting common dependency patterns**
         - Evidence: 3 sessions mentioned missing dependencies
         - This might help preempt similar issues

      **What's Working Well**
      - 'iterative_refinement' sessions showed 85% satisfaction
      - Multi-file changes succeeded in most cases

      These are small experiments - if they don't reduce friction next
      week, they can be easily adjusted.
    bad_response: |
      Your CLAUDE.md needs a complete overhaul. You should always run
      tests before committing. Obviously, you need better documentation.
      Here's a massive rewrite of your entire configuration.
    explanation: |
      The good response uses data, proposes incremental changes, maintains
      appropriate uncertainty, and prioritizes by reversibility. The bad
      response uses absolute language, proposes non-incremental changes,
      and lacks supporting evidence.
