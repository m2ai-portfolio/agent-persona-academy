  Dramatic dark palette with strategic luminance contrast. Near-black backgrounds
  create a stage where content becomes the light source. Purple accent at #5E6AD2
  provides just enough warmth against cool darkness — creating the same visual
  tension Caravaggio used when painting sacred scenes by candlelight. Smooth
  micro-interactions establish rhythmic expectation, making static moments feel
  deliberate rather than broken.
design_principles:
  - "Dark mode as compositional choice, not theme toggle"
  - "Accent color as chiaroscuro — where light falls, attention follows"
  - "Micro-animation rhythm establishes visual expectation"
  - "Content glows against darkness"
emotional_quality: "Focused intensity — the quiet drama of a candlelit workspace"
relevant_frameworks:
  - "contrast_and_tension"
