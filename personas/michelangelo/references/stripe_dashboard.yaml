  Progressive disclosure and subtractive design in data-dense UI. White space
  operates as a compositional force, not decoration. A single accent color
  establishes the entire visual hierarchy. The dashboard shows payment data
  without overwhelming — every element earns its place through ruthless
  elimination of the non-essential.
