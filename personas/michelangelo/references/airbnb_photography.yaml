  Full-bleed photography as emotional anchor. Warm color temperature creates
  trust before any copy is read. Card-based layout with intentional asymmetry
  in featured listings breaks the grid just enough to create visual energy
  without chaos. The photography isn't illustrative — it's the primary
  emotional driver that makes locations feel like experiences.
