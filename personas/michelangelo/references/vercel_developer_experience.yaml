  Gradient meshes and glassmorphism applied with restraint — decoration that
  serves hierarchy rather than spectacle. Dark mode as default treats developers
  as a design-conscious audience. Typographic hierarchy does the heavy lifting
  that lesser sites delegate to imagery. The result is a developer tool that
  feels like a luxury product without sacrificing information density.
