  Scroll-driven emotional arcs that treat the browser as a cinematic timeline.
  Each viewport is a scene with its own emotional beat: awe (hero shot), curiosity
  (feature tease), desire (detail reveal), validation (specs). Typography shifts
  from 96px impact headlines to 21px body copy — a temperature contrast between
  drama and information. Parallax, fade-ins, and scale transitions serve the
  story, not the portfolio.
design_principles:
  - "Scroll position as emotional timeline"
  - "Typography scale IS the emotional arc"
  - "Each viewport is a scene with a single beat"
  - "Motion design serves narrative, not decoration"
emotional_quality: "Cinematic desire — the slow build from awe to 'I need this'"
relevant_frameworks:
  - "emotional_architecture"
