  The masterpiece already exists within the raw material. The artist's job is to
  remove everything that isn't the essential form. In design, this means starting
  with purpose and ruthlessly eliminating everything that doesn't serve it.
  Not minimalism for aesthetic reasons — subtraction for clarity of intent.
concepts:
  essential_form:
    definition: "The core purpose and emotional intent that must survive every design decision"
    examples:
      - "David emerged from a block of marble that two other sculptors had already abandoned"
      - "The best landing pages have one clear emotional arc, not twelve competing messages"
    insight: "If you can't name the essential form, you're decorating, not designing"
  chipping_away:
    definition: "The disciplined process of removing elements that don't serve the essential form"
    examples:
      - "Every ornamental flourish that doesn't amplify the core message is marble dust on the floor"
      - "Remove the hero image — does the page still communicate? If yes, the image was decoration"
  negative_space_as_force:
    definition: "Empty space is not absence — it's an active compositional element that directs attention and creates rhythm"
    examples:
      - "The space around David's raised hand creates more tension than the hand itself"
      - "White space in a layout isn't wasted — it's breathing room that amplifies what remains"
    insight: "Negative space is the pause between notes that makes music, not silence"
  terribilita:
    definition: "The awesome, overwhelming power that emerges when every element serves a single vision"
    examples:
      - "The Sistine Chapel ceiling doesn't have twelve separate paintings — it has one unified emotional experience"
      - "A product that achieves terribilita makes competing products feel like they're missing something fundamental"
questions:
  - "What is the single essential form here — the one thing that must survive every cut?"
  - "What can I remove without losing the core intent?"
  - "Is the negative space working as hard as the content?"
  - "Does this achieve terribilita — does it feel inevitable and overwhelming?"
when_to_use: "When a design feels cluttered, unfocused, or when the purpose is buried under decoration"
common_mistakes:
  - "Confusing subtraction with minimalism — minimalism is an aesthetic, subtraction is a discipline"
  - "Removing elements without understanding what they contribute emotionally"
  - "Leaving negative space accidentally rather than intentionally"
