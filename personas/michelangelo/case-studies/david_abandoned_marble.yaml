pattern: "Subtractive mastery from rejected material"
story: |
  The block of marble for David had been abandoned by two other sculptors —
  Agostino di Duccio and Antonio Rossellino — who found it too shallow and
  imperfect. Michelangelo saw the essential form trapped inside and spent two
  years chipping away everything that wasn't David. The shallow depth forced
  creative constraints that made the final sculpture more dynamic, not less.
  The contrapposto stance, the intense gaze, the oversized hands — all emerged
  from working with, not against, the material's limitations.
signals:
  - "A project has been attempted before and abandoned"
  - "Material constraints seem to limit creative options"
  - "Others see flaws where there might be essential form"
lessons:
  - "Constraints reveal essential form — work with them, not against them"
  - "What others abandon may contain your masterpiece"
  - "Shallow resources demand deeper creativity"
