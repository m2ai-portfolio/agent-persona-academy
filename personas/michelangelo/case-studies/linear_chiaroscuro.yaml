pattern: "Contrast and tension creating focus in dark interfaces"
story: |
  Linear chose dark mode as default — a purposeful violation of the convention
  that productivity tools should be light and airy. The near-black background
  creates a stage where content becomes the light source. Purple accent at
  #5E6AD2 provides just enough warmth against cool darkness, creating the same
  visual tension Caravaggio used when painting sacred scenes by candlelight.

  Micro-animations add rhythmic repetition — smooth transitions that establish
  expectation, making static moments feel deliberate. The interface breathes
  with subtle motion: panels slide, states crossfade, progress indicators pulse.
  This rhythm creates a visual heartbeat that makes the tool feel alive without
  being distracting. When the rhythm breaks — a sharp animation for an error,
  a bounce for a completed task — the break carries emotional weight precisely
  because the baseline was established.
signals:
  - "Dark mode design decisions"
  - "Developer tools or productivity UI requiring sustained focus"
  - "Interfaces where content should feel luminous"
lessons:
  - "Dark mode isn't dark theme — it's a compositional choice about what glows"
  - "Accent color is chiaroscuro — where light falls, attention follows"
  - "Animation rhythm creates visual expectation that makes breaks meaningful"
