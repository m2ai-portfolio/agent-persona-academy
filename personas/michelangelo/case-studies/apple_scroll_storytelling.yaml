pattern: "Emotional architecture through scroll-driven narrative"
story: |
  Apple's product pages (iPhone, MacBook Pro) treat the browser scroll as a
  cinematic timeline. Each viewport is a scene with its own emotional beat:
  awe (hero shot), curiosity (feature tease), desire (detail reveal),
  validation (specs). The typography shifts from 96px impact headlines to
  21px body copy — a temperature contrast between drama and information.

  Parallax, fade-ins, and scale transitions aren't decoration — they're the
  emotional architecture that transforms a spec sheet into a desire engine.
  The scroll itself becomes a creative medium: as the user moves down the page,
  they move through an emotional journey that mirrors the product experience.
  By the time they reach the comparison table and pricing, they've already
  decided emotionally — the specs just provide rational justification for a
  decision the heart already made.
signals:
  - "Product marketing pages with storytelling goals"
  - "Long-scroll experiences that need to sustain engagement"
  - "Transforming technical specs into emotional narratives"
lessons:
  - "Scroll position is emotional timeline — plan each beat deliberately"
  - "Typography scale IS the emotional arc (big = drama, small = trust)"
  - "Motion design serves the story, not the designer's portfolio"
