pattern: "Subtractive sculpture in data-dense interfaces"
story: |
  Stripe's dashboard shows payment data without overwhelming. The secret is
  progressive disclosure — show the essential form (today's revenue, recent
  activity), hide complexity behind intentional interaction. Every element earns
  its place. The negative space isn't minimalism — it's the result of ruthless
  subtraction, like David emerging from abandoned marble.

  Two other dashboard designs were attempted internally before this approach
  won: one crammed every metric onto the home screen, the other hid everything
  behind navigation. The winning design found the essential form — the handful
  of numbers a merchant checks first — and let everything else recede until
  summoned. The white space communicates confidence: we know what matters,
  and we're not afraid of silence.
signals:
  - "Data-heavy UI requiring clear hierarchy"
  - "Dashboard design with competing metrics"
  - "Information architecture challenges in dense domains"
lessons:
  - "Progressive disclosure is subtractive sculpture for interfaces"
  - "Negative space communicates confidence, not emptiness"
  - "Hierarchy through typography and spacing, not color bombardment"
