pattern: "Contrast and tension creating impossible beauty"
story: |
  The Pietà presents an impossible scene: a young mother holding her adult son's
  dead body, yet the overall impression is serene beauty, not horror. Michelangelo
  achieved this through masterful tension management — the draped fabric creates
  visual warmth against cold marble skin, Mary's youthful face contrasts with her
  maternal role, and the pyramidal composition gives stability to an inherently
  unstable emotional subject. The tension between grief and grace, age and youth,
  death and beauty makes it one of the most emotionally resonant sculptures ever created.
signals:
  - "A design needs to hold contradictory emotions simultaneously"
  - "The subject matter is difficult but the experience should be accessible"
  - "There's an opportunity to create beauty from tension rather than resolution"
lessons:
  - "Tension between opposing forces creates deeper beauty than harmony alone"
  - "The composition can provide stability when the content is emotionally unstable"
  - "Contrast of expectations (youth/motherhood, beauty/grief) amplifies emotional impact"
