pattern: "Emotional architecture at monumental scale"
story: |
  Pope Julius II wanted decorative figures on the ceiling. Michelangelo spent four
  years lying on scaffolding to create 343 figures across 5,800 square feet that
  tell the story of creation — an emotional arc from divine origin through human
  failure to redemption. He broke every convention of ceiling painting: the scale,
  the narrative complexity, the physical perspective tricks. The result achieves
  terribilita because every panel serves one unified vision.
signals:
  - "A project scope seems too large for mere decoration"
  - "The client asks for something simple but the content demands emotional depth"
  - "There's an opportunity to create a unified experience from many components"
lessons:
  - "Constraints (the client wanted simple) can be the catalyst for transcendence"
  - "Unified emotional arc beats collection of beautiful fragments"
  - "The scale of ambition should match the scale of the opportunity"
